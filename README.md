# Code On Books
code examples in ruby from books I read.

Currently I am reading Algorithms Unplugged book.

I plan to make this repo serve as a documentation for me of the books i have read so far.
There are several books that I have read/plan to read.

I only started reading technical books one year ago while serving in the millitary as it was the only learning resource available for me. And gladly, it is now my number one choice of resource when it comes to learning a new concept/technology now.

Given that i can access a computer now, i shall revise the books i have read and apply the concepts i learned by coding.

I will revise/read next in order:-
- Grokking Algorithms (Done reading :white_check_mark:)
- Headfirst Object-Oriented Programming (Done reading :white_check_mark:)
- Headfirst Design patterns (Done reading :white_check_mark:)
- Clean Code (not yet :large_blue_circle:)
- Clean Architecture (not yet :large_blue_circle:)
- Learning SQL (Done reading :white_check_mark:)
- Well-Grounded Rubyist (not yet :large_blue_circle:)
- The Rails 5 way (not yet :large_blue_circle:)

These are the current books that are on my shelf right now. I guess the order of the reading is subject to change, depends on my changing needs while working. I will also try to write a short personal summary/review after reading/revising each book.
