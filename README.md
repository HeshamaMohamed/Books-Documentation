# Code On Books

Code examples from books I read. I write them in Ruby.  
Alongside my thoughts on them while reading (you can find them in every chapter's README.md).

Currently, I am reading The Well-Grounded Rubyist.  
More into why I started reading it can be found in its README.md.  

## Why start this?
I have 4 reasons in mind.  
First, It would serve as documentation for my learning process and reading journey.  
Second, It would be a helpful future reference for me while coding.  
Third, I want to practice my writing skills. So, any feedback on this would be very appreciated.  
Fourth, It might benefit anyone who starts to begin writing Ruby code.

## My history with books.
Throughout my life, I have read only a few books. This is not something I am proud of. That is why I decided to change it back in January 2021.  

I started reading technical books in January 2021. That was when I first started serving in the military (mandatory service).  
Why books? It was the only learning resource available to me back then. Also I have seen many people describing books as the best learning resource and encouraging everyone to read.  
It first seemed like a big limitation for my learning journey. I always favored the video content when it comes to learning.  

After a while, I saw it as an opportunity rather than a limitation, I thought it is the best time to build a reading habit. 
Gladly, it is now my favorite type of resource when it comes to learning a new concept/technology.  

I experienced something different from the video courses I used to learn from.  
I started to visualize the big picture rather than consume small bites of information with no proper linking between them or why they even existed.  
I loved the way the books propose a problem and its solution in a fitting context. The way they link the information together to provide you with a deep understanding is invaluable. 

So, over 14 months I have been able to read 9 total books. 6 of which are technical and 3 are non-technical. 
Given the circumstances back then and my new phase with books, I am satisfied with the result as a beginning. Unfortunately, I couldn't put what I read into practice back then. 
However, now that I can do so, I decided to give it a go.

## Reading plan

I will be documenting the books I have read in addition to books I am planning to read. 
The reading order of the books may vary over time according to my needs and vision. 
However, suggestions are very welcome and appreciated.

I will revise/read next in order:-
- Well-Grounded Rubyist (Currently Reading)
- Grokking Algorithms (Done reading :white_check_mark:)
- Headfirst Object-Oriented Programming (Done reading :white_check_mark:)
- Headfirst Design patterns (Done reading :white_check_mark:)
- Clean Code (not yet :large_blue_circle:)
- Clean Architecture (not yet :large_blue_circle:)
- The Rails 5 way (not yet :large_blue_circle:)
- Test Driven Development by example (not yet :large_blue_circle:)
- Learning SQL (Done reading :white_check_mark:)
- Designing Data Intensive Applications (not yet :large_blue_circle:)

These are the current books on my shelf right now. I will also try to write a short personal summary/review after reading/revising each book.

All kinds of advice are appreciated, feel free to provide me with feedback on anything you think could be improved, thanks :).
