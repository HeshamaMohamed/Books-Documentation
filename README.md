# Code On Books

Code snippets from the books I have read, written in Ruby.  
Alongside some of my thoughts on them while reading (you can find them in every chapter's README.md).  

Currently, I am reading The Practical Object-oriented design by Sandi Metz.  

## Why start this?
I have 4 reasons in mind.  
First, It would serve as documentation for my learning process and reading journey.  
Second, It would be a helpful future reference for me while coding.  
Third, I want to practice my writing skills. So, any feedback on this would be very appreciated.  
Fourth, It might benefit anyone who starts to begin writing Ruby code.

## My history with books.
Throughout my life, I have read only a few books.  
This is something I wanted to change for so long, and finally, I did back then in January 2021.  

I started reading technical books. That was when I first started serving in the military (mandatory service).  
So, why books?  
In addition to wanting to read for so long, it was the only learning resource available in the military.  

It first seemed like a big limitation for my learning journey. I always favored the video content when it comes to learning.  
After a while, I saw it as an opportunity rather than a limitation, it was the best time to build a reading habit.  
Gladly, it is now my favorite type of resource when it comes to learning a new concept/technology.  
And now, I am no longer satisfied with incomplete knowledge or just a shallow understanding of the topics I see important.

I experienced something different from the video courses I used to learn from.  
I started to visualize the big picture rather than consume small bites of information with no proper linking between them.
What I loved most were:
- The way they build your knowledge from the bottom up starting from the root of the problem and the various solutions with each's pros and cons to decide on which one fits better.  
- the way they propose a problem and its solution in a fitting context.  
- The way they link the information together to provide you with a deep understanding of the topic.  


So, over 14 months (till March 2022) I have been able to read 9 total books. 6 of which are technical and 3 non-technical.  
Given the circumstances back then and my new phase with books, I am satisfied with the result as a beginning.  
Unfortunately, I couldn't put what I read into practice back then. 
However, now that I can do so, I decided to give it a go.

## Reading Plan

I will be documenting the books I have read in addition to the books I am planning to read.  
The reading order of the books may vary over time according to my needs and vision.  
However, suggestions are very welcome and appreciated.



I will revise/read next in order:-
- Well-Grounded Rubyist (Read :white_check_mark:, Documented :white_check_mark:)
- Design Patterns In Ruby (Read :white_check_mark:, Documented :white_check_mark:)
- Practical Object Oriented Design (Read :white_check_mark:, Documented :white_check_mark:)
- Test Driven Development by Example (Read :large_blue_circle:, Documented :large_blue_circle:)
- Test Driven Development in Ruby (Read :large_blue_circle:, Documented :large_blue_circle:)
- The Rails 5 way (Read :large_blue_circle:, Documented :large_blue_circle:)
- Grokking Algorithms (Read :white_check_mark:, Documented :large_blue_circle:)
- Headfirst Object-Oriented Programming (Read :white_check_mark:, Documented :large_blue_circle:)
- Headfirst Design patterns (Read :white_check_mark:, Documented :large_blue_circle:)
- Clean Code (Read :large_blue_circle:, Documented :large_blue_circle:)
- Clean Architecture (Read :large_blue_circle:, Documented :large_blue_circle:)
- Designing Data Intensive Applications (Read: :large_blue_circle:, Documented :large_blue_circle:)
- Algorithms Unplugged (Read :large_blue_circle:, Documented :large_blue_circle:)

These are the current books on my shelf right now. I will also try to write a short personal summary/review after reading/revising each book.

All kinds of advice are appreciated, feel free to provide me with feedback on anything you think could be improved, thanks :).
