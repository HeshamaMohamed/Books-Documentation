## Chapter 7:  Built-in essentials

### Topics covered in this chapter:
- Ruby's literal constructors
- Syntactic sugar converting methods into operators
- "Destructive" methods and bang methods
- Conversion methods (to_s and friends)
- The inspect and display methods
- Boolean values and Boolean objects
- The special object nil
- Comparing objects and the Comparable module
- Examining an object's methods



### Personal thoughts

- I can say I am familiar with most of the information presented in this chapter. It was a good refreshing though and explained more details.

- I always found the creation of operator methods very cool. It makes life easier lots of cases.

- It was good to know the convention of not using '!' in method names unless there's an equivalent name without an '!'.

- I liked how the to_i ignores the non-integer parts of a string if it is not entirely made of numbers.
