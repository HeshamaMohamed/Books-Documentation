## Chapter 15: Callbacks, hooks, and runtime introspection

### Topics covered in this chapter:
- Intercepting methods with method_missing
- Runtime hooks and callbacks for objects, classes, and modules
- Querying objects about their methods, on various criteria
- Trapping references to unknown constants
- Stack traces
- Writing the MicroTest framework


### Personal thoughts

- Although The topics covered in this chapter seems very advanced to me as I didn't have much applications in mind when i got exposed to them, but it was very interesting, especially the part where we came to implement a MicroTesting tool.
- I think that chapters like this needs to be revisited every once in a while so you could reflect on the problems/experiences you recently had and if you could apply the concepts present in the chapter to improve them.
