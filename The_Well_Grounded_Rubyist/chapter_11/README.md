- Parenthetical captures
- Quantifiers
- Modifiers
- Anchors
- MatchData objectsString/regexp interpolation and conversion
- Ruby methods that use regexps: scan, split, grep, sub, gsub

### Personal thoughts

- First time I got introduced to regular expressions was in college, specifically in the Compiler design course. at first, It seemed hard but after some practice, i got the hold of it.  
    It is so powerful and could save you lots of code. However, it is easier to write it than read it. It might be hard for people who aren't familiar with regex to read it and understand it easily.

- I struggled a little bit with last the exercise. I couldn't solve the last requirement. I think I need to practice more to get the hold of the topic.

- Over all, this chapter was a nice introduction to regexp in Ruby. Hopefully i'll be able to use it in the future whenever I need it.
