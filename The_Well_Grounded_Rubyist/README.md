# The Well-Grounded Rubyist

## Why this book?

TL;DR, I want to gain deep knowledge of the ruby language to be able to think of more innovative ways to solve problems.

While trying to implement some algorithms presented in the "Algorithms Unplugged" book using Ruby, I noticed that I am missing something.

A brief history about my college education. I started programming in C++ and got stuck with it for most of my 4 college years. Of course, I did experiment with several languages but it was mostly C++.  

They (the lecturers) were trying to achieve 2 goals. First, help us establish a problem-solving mindset. Second, get a clear understanding of how programming works under the hood.   We were instructed to reinvent the wheel whenever we needed a simple algorithm for our assignments/projects.

We were not allowed to use the language's built-in algorithms/data structures.
Instead of using the predefined List data structure, we created our implementation of it.  
Even a simple 3-line sorting algorithm didn't pass. instead of just using the **array.sort**, we were made to write it up from scratch.

They were not trying to torture us.
I am glad they cared to teach us this way. 
Surely that helped me establish some kind of a "problem solving" mindset and understand more about how programming works deeply with pointers and memory allocation.  
However, that caused me some headaches later when I tried programming in Ruby.  

I was Introduced to ruby when I first enrolled in AppAcademy Bootcamp during my 4th year in college. Which teaches React On Rails stack.  
I was fascinated by the ease of use, expressiveness, and the plenty of helpful built-in functions that would spare me from writing lots of repeated code.  

However, after getting used to the language, I noticed that I have a problem. I was not thinking as a Rubyist.
I had found that whenever I got to think about how to program something, I still thought of it as if I am writing C++ code.  
That filled my head with all the tiny details that I had to consider when writing with C++.  

That proposed 2 side effects that I could think of.  
First, all of those details that filled my head could reduce how much I can think of the solution vertically. By vertical I mean the number of sequential steps I can chunk in my working memory thinking of a solution. That was inspired by the research of [The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)

Secondly, I couldn't find a way to implement some solutions I thought of.  
Why? e.g; While trying to implement an algorithm, I considered the ability to use pointers, which is true in C++ and works fine.  
However, I found that ruby doesn't deal with pointers.  
That served as an obstacle back then and caused me a burnout.  

I thought there must be a way to implement this in ruby. That was when I realized that I am missing the knowledge of the language. After checking reviews about books on ruby, I settled on this book.
