# The Well-Grounded Rubyist

## Why this book?

TL;DR, I want to gain deep knowledge of the ruby language so I can think of more innovative ways to solve problems.

after spending a while reading 'Algorithms Unplugged' book and trying to implement the algorithms inside of it myself in ruby, I noticed that i am missing something.

Well, I started programming in C++ and stuck with it for most of my 4 college years. ofcourse I did experiment other several languages but mostly it was C++.  

They were trying to make us establish a problem-solving mindset and have a clear understanding of how programming works under the hood, and by that, we were forced us re-invent the wheel whenever we needed a simple algorithm in our assignments/projects.

we were not allowed to use the built-in algorithms/data structures in the language.  
Instead of using the built-in Lists data structure, we created our own implementation of linked-list.  
even a simple 3-line sorting algorithm didn't intercede for us. instead of just using the **array.sort**, we were made to write it up from scratch.

I don't mean to talk about it as if they were torturing us, 
I am glad they cared to teach us that. 
And that surely helped me establishing some kind of "problem solving" mindset and understanding more about how programming works under the hood as with pointers and memory allocation.  
However, that caused me some headache later when I tried programming in ruby.  

I was Introduced to ruby when I first enrolled to AppAcademy bootcamp that teaches React On Rails stack in my senior college year.  
I was fascinated by the ease of use, expressiveness and the plenty of helpful built-in functions that would spare me from writing lots of repeated code.  
to sum it up, I had much better user-experience when programming in Ruby rather than C++, C#, etc..

Now,about the headache I mentioned above and the missing part that I mentioned earlier.  
After getting used to program in ruby I noticed that I have problem with overcoming "Thinking In C++" and "becoming a rubyist".  
I had found that whenever I get to think about how to program something, I still think of it as if I am writing C++, and filling my head with all the tiny details that i had to consider when writing with C++.  

There are 2 side effects that I could think of.  
First, all of those details that filled my head could reduce how much horizontally i can think of the solution.  by horizontal I mean the number of sequential steps I can chunk in my working memory while thinking for a solution. And that was inspired by the research of [The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)

Secondly, I couldn't find a way to implement some solutions i thought of.  
Why? an example is that while trying to implement an algorithm i built my implementation based on using pointers, which is pretty valid in C++ and would work perfectly.  
However, I found out that ruby doesn't deal with pointers and only uses objects. 
That served as an obstacle back then and caused me to burnout.  

I thought there must be a way to implement this in ruby, that is when I realized that I am missing the knowledge of the language. After checking reviews about books on ruby, I settled on this book.
