## Chapter 12: File and I/O Operations

### Topics covered in this chapter:
- I/O (keyboard and screen) and file operations in Ruby
- File objects as enumerables
- The STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR objects
- The FileUtils module
- The Pathname module
- The StringIO class
- The open-uri module


### Personal thoughts

- I haven't used I/O in programming that much, just simple read/write from files whenever I needed it.
    However, I have been wanting to learn more about them. every once in a while,I face some boring tasks related to organizing/renaming files in my directories. Whenever I face them, I wish if I had the proper programming knowledge related to I/O to automate these tasks.
- I have been thinking about reading The "Automate the boring stuff with python" book that seemed to teach these tricks. However, I still thought it would be better if I learn to do it in Ruby.

- I have learned alot of interesting things in this chapter, It would benefit me so much, especially when I get to write scripts to automate local tasks on my machine.
