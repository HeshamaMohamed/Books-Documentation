## Chapter 9:  Collection and container objects

### Topics covered in this chapter:
- How to create, manipulate, and transform collection objects including:
    - Arrays
    - Hashes
    - Ranges
    - Sets
- Named Arguments




### Personal thoughts

- like chapter 8 or even more, most of the information in the chapter I had already encountered before.

- Unfortunately, I was expecting the book to dig deeper into hashes internally and illustrate its mechanisms in detail.
    Although It did well illustrating how to use it , I still craved the knowledge of how it operates internally. 
    It seems like I'll be searching for that elsewhere.

- I haven't worked with sets much before. It was good learning about them in more detail, like how they simulate the same mechanism of hash keys for uniqueness.
