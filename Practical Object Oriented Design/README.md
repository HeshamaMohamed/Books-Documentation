# Practical Object Oriented Design ~ Sandi Metz.

This book was recommended to me by a friend/mentor of mine.

I was skeptical when I first learned about it because I have already spent some time reading OOP books (Headfirst OOD, OOP Thought Process).  
I thought to myself, it is probably just the same content but written in ruby instead of java, etc...  

However, I was curious to look into its table of content and see what it is offering.  
3 of the chapter titles (chapter 5, 7, and 9) grabbed my attention as they looked unfamiliar to me regarding OOP.  
Taking a little peek, I found that it has a different narrative than the other OOP books I have read.  
After reading some reviews about it online and listening to one of the author's talks, I decided to order the book and take a deep dive.

It was a very insightful journey, it has changed my way of thinking completely about OOP.  
Especially the last chapter about testing, I think it deserves a book on its own.  

The author's style is very well engaging.  
The explanations are to the point without useless information to fill the pages.  
The guidelines and lessons are priceless.  
I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to write a good maintainable OOP in Ruby.

I made sure to note some quotes that I found insightful inside each chapter and list them in the READMEs of them.  
The quotes I mentioned don't come close to summarizing the chapters' lessons.  
So, if you think that's what it is all about, you are mistaken and you still need to read the book.

  All I did was:
  - Extracting Redundant code from multiple files into separate ones to be included for more readability.
  - Rename files to have descriptive names for better navigation.
