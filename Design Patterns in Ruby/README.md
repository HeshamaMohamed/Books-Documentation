# Design Patterns in Ruby

## Why this book?

I have read Headfirst design patterns a while ago. I was fascinated by the solutions (patterns) it provides to common problems that we face almost every day.  
However, I had no idea how to transform these patterns written in Java into idiomatic Ruby. I had an idea about how to implement them in Ruby.  
But I wasn't sure if I would come up with the best approach and utilize the language's power to that.  
So I thought it might be a good idea to learn from the people who have been implementing these patterns in Ruby for years.
